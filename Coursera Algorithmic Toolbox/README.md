## Coursera Algortithmic Toolbox

In this course I have learned about some of the basic techniques to solve algorithmic problems. Starting on greedy algorithms, I also learned about some optimizations on those techniques, in particular of those consisting on brute force, which can consume a lot of memory and time making the same steps again and again. Here I have learned about specific recursive algorithms such as Fibonacci numbers, greatest common divisor and some basics about Big-O notation. After that, some divide and conquer techniques appeared such as the knapsack problem or the best loot problem, the most optimum way to fuel a car with the less number of stops possible and ordering a child party by grups of approximately the same age.
